All the programing questioons were easier than puting numbers in order. I finnsihed all of them really quick. And I like python so much more than every other lanugage we used till now.

Today's to do list:
1. We looked at computational thinking. Computational thinking consists of decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithmic thinking
1. Make program in python that finds bigest prime factor of 10 numbers enetered
1. Come up with inventory systems we need, and pick developer and client. I need to develop instrument inventory system for Tom


I learned how to use functions / libraries in python and it is really usefull. I think everything was preatty celar so I don't have any questions today

Today's to do list:
1. Client - developer interviews
1. Start coding secure login system

Client - developer interviews went bad. People were not prepared and they didn't even know what they want. We were just loosing time with that probably for one hour. After that we started coding encrypted login part of the program. I never really undesrtood basic priciple of how login can be secure. Now when we coded it, it actually makes sense. This was interesting for me because it was kinda related to the topic of my EE.
