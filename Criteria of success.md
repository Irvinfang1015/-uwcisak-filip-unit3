Criteria of success
=======================

### Clients requirements:
There are many guitar players in UWC ISAK Japan, and each of us have different types of guitars. I think it can be very nice sometimes to borrow other people’s guitar and play, as it feels very different and special, but I never know who has a guitar or what type of guitar they have. So maybe a system where we can lend and borrow each other’s guitar would be quite nice. A guitar can come in different types such as: electric, acoustic, bass,… and also different colors and wood types as well. I want the system to be accessed by me at first, and if possible, we can extend this so every guitarist have the opportunity to access this feature.

## Success criteria:
1. Being able to add guitar and specify it's properties (Type of guitar, color of guitar, type of wood)
2. Log date when guitar is borrowed and when returned
3. Log who took it
4. System is secoure, user is the only one who can access it
