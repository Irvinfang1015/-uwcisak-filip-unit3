Criteria of success
=======================

# Definition of a problem
Client want a system which will enable him to keep track of his guitars. The problem he is facing right now is that he needs to remember to who he lended his guitar and that can lead to missunderstandings. To avoid that, my client was rather not leding his guitar to anyone so inventory will be big improvement. So what he wants now is inventory, where he will be able to add guitar, specify it's properties and than log the date when it was borrowd and by who.

## Proposed solution
I am going to design a Guitar Inventory software application for my client including a secured login system. The software application will help my client to reliably track who is using which guitar and the characteristics of each of this guitars such as type, colour and type of wood. To create that program I will be using python, because that is the programing langugage we are learning to code with in class right now. Syntax is not demanding and all the librarys existing for it, offeres countles coding possibilities.

Problem was defined and solution was proposed based on first user email and short interview. Accesible in [appendix folder](/Inventoryproject/Appendix/)

## Success criteria:
1. Being able to add guitar and specify it's properties (Type of guitar, color of guitar, type of wood)
2. Log date when guitar is borrowed and when returned and by who
3. System is secure, user is the only one who can access it

**Coment on succes criteria** Succes criteria is maybe not defined enaught at this point. I will keep in touch with client, and keep him updated on development to see if his requirements will change.
