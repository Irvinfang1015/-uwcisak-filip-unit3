Criteria of success
=======================

# Definition of a problem
Client want a system which will enable him to keep track of his guitars. The problem he is facing right now is that he needs to remember to who he lended his guitar and that can lead to missunderstandings. To avoid that, my client was rather not leding his guitar to anyone so inventory will be big improvement. So what he wants now is inventory, where he will be able to add guitar, specify it's properties and than log the date when it was borrowd and by who.
### Clients requirements:
There are many guitar players in UWC ISAK Japan, and each of us have different types of guitars. I think it can be very nice sometimes to borrow other people’s guitar and play, as it feels very different and special, but I never know who has a guitar or what type of guitar they have. So maybe a system where we can lend and borrow each other’s guitar would be quite nice. A guitar can come in different types such as: electric, acoustic, bass,… and also different colors and wood types as well. I want the system to be accessed by me at first, and if possible, we can extend this so every guitarist have the opportunity to access this feature.

## Success criteria:
1. Being able to add guitar and specify it's properties (Type of guitar, color of guitar, type of wood)
2. Log date when guitar is borrowed and when returned and by who
3. System is secure, user is the only one who can access it
4. System is responsive
